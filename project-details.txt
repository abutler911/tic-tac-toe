Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

    HTML:
        Create a basic layout for your tic-tac-toe board (a 3x3 grid).
        Add elements for player status, turn indication, and a reset button.

    CSS:
        Style your tic-tac-toe board and game elements. Use flexbox or grid for layout.
        Consider responsive design to ensure the game looks good on various devices.

    JavaScript:
        Handle the game logic (player turns, win conditions, etc.).
        Interact with the backend to send/receive game updates.

Backend (Node.js, Socket.IO)

    Node.js:
        Set up a basic server to handle client connections and game state.
        You can use Express.js for easy routing and management.

    Socket.IO:
        Use Socket.IO for real-time communication between clients and the server.
        It allows you to emit and listen for events (like player moves) in real-time.

Basic Steps to Implement

    Set Up Your Node.js Server:
        Initialize a new Node.js project and set up Express.js.
        Install Socket.IO and integrate it with your server.

    Create Game Logic on the Server:
        Manage game state, including player turns and win conditions.
        Use sockets to update both players about the game state changes.

    Connect Frontend with Backend:
        Use Socket.IO client library in your frontend to connect with your Node.js server.
        Emit events from the frontend (like player moves) and listen for updates from the server.

    Gameplay:
        Players should be able to join a game.
        Implement game logic to check for win conditions and draw conditions.
        Update players about their turn, game status, and when the game is over.

    Testing:
        Test the game locally, then deploy your Node.js server on a cloud platform (like Heroku) for online access.

    Additional Features:
        Player authentication (optional).
        Ability to play multiple games simultaneously.
        Chat feature for players to communicate.
